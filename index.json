		"summary":"In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve the Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SC-OPF) Problem. We consider a network of devices, each with its own dynamic constraints and objective, subject to reliability constraints across multiple scenarios. Each scenario corresponds to the failure or degradation of a set of devices and has an associated probability of occurrence. The network objective is to minimize the cost of operation of all devices, over a given time horizon, across all scenarios subject to the constraints of transmission limit, upper and lower generating limits, generation-load balance etc. This is a large optimization problem, with variables for consumption and generation for each device, in each scenario. In this paper, we extend the proximal message passing framework to handle reliability constraints across scenarios. The resulting algorithm is extremely scalable with respect to both network size and the number of scenarios.",

		"summary":"Despite strong connections through shared application areas, research efforts on power market optimization (e.g., unit commitment) and power network optimization (e.g., optimal power flow) remain largely independent. A notable illustration of this is the treatment of power generation cost functions, where nonlinear network optimization has largely used polynomial representations and market optimization has adopted piecewise linear encodings. This work combines state-of-the-art results from both lines of research to understand the best mathematical formulations of the nonlinear AC optimal power flow problem with piecewise linear generation cost functions. An extensive numerical analysis of non-convex models, linear approximations, and convex relaxations across fifty-four realistic test cases illustrates that nonlinear optimization methods are surprisingly sensitive to the mathematical formulation of piecewise linear functions. The results indicate that a poor formulation choice can slow down algorithm performance by a factor of ten, increasing the runtime from seconds to minutes. These results provide valuable insights into the best formulations of nonlinear optimal power flow problems with piecewise linear cost functions, a important step towards building a new generation of energy markets that incorporate the nonlinear AC power flow model.",

		"summary":"The recent emergence of novel computational devices, such as quantum computers, neuromorphic co-processors and digital annealers presents new opportunities for hardware accelerated hybrid optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, demonstrations of unquestionable performance gains leveraging novel hardware platforms have faced significant obstacles. One key challenge is understanding the algorithmic properties that distinguish such devices from established optimization approaches. Through the careful design of contrived optimization tasks, this work provides new insights into the computation properties of quantum annealing and suggests that this model has an uncanny ability to avoid local minima and quickly identify the structure of high quality solutions. A meticulous comparison to a variety of algorithms spanning both complete and local search suggest that quantum annealing's performance on the proposed optimization tasks is unique. This result provides new insights into the time scales and types of optimization problems where quantum annealing has the potential to provide notable performance gains over established optimization algorithms and prompts the development of hybrid algorithms that combine the best features of quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical approaches.",

		"summary":"In recent years, the power systems research community has seen an explosion of novel methods for formulating the AC power flow equations. Consequently, benchmarking studies using the seminal AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem have emerged as the primary method for evaluating these emerging methods. However, it is often difficult to directly compare these studies due to subtle differences in the AC-OPF problem formulation as well as the network, generation, and loading data that are used for evaluation. To help address these challenges, this IEEE PES Task Force report proposes a standardized AC-OPF mathematical formulation and the PGLib-OPF networks for benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms. A motivating study demonstrates some limitations of the established network datasets in the context of benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms and a validation study demonstrates the efficacy of using the PGLib-OPF networks for this purpose. In the interest of scientific discourse and future additions, the PGLib-OPF benchmark library is open-access and all the of network data is provided under a creative commons license.",

In this work, we propose the idea of an Ising processing unit as a computational abstraction for reasoning about these emerging devices. The challenges involved in using and benchmarking these devices are presented and commercial mixed integer programming solvers are proposed as a valuable tool for the validation of these disparate hardware platforms. The proposed validation methodology is demonstrated on a D-Wave 2X adiabatic quantum computer, one example of an Ising processing unit. The computational results demonstrate that the D-Wave hardware consistently produces high-quality solutions and suggests that as IPU technology matures it could become a valuable co-processor in hybrid-optimization algorithms.",

This AC Minimal Load-Shedding (AC-MLS) task is a non-convex nonlinear optimization problem, which can be incredibly challenging to solve on large-scale transmission system data sets. This work demonstrates that convex relaxations of the AC-MLS problem provide a reliable and scalable method for finding high-quality bounds on the amount of active power load shedding required in the AC-MLS problem. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the solution methods proposed in this work are rigorously evaluated on 1000 N-k scenarios on seven power networks ranging in size from 70 to 6000 buses. The most effective relaxation of the AC-MLS problem converges in less than 20 seconds on commodity computing hardware for all 7000 of the scenarios considered.","tags":["selected"],"title":"Relaxations of AC Maximal Load Delivery for Severe Contingency Analysis","type":"publication"},

Unfortunately, the sophistication of these emerging methods often presents a significant barrier to evaluating them on a wide variety of power system optimization applications. To address this issue, this work proposes PowerModels, an open-source platform for comparing power flow formulations. From its inception, PowerModels was designed to streamline the process of evaluating different power flow formulations on shared optimization problem specifications.

The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is a departure from these relaxations in the sense that it imposes constraints to preserve stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation. This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC optimal power flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.","tags":["selected"],"title":"The QC Relaxation: A Theoretical and Computational Study on Optimal Power Flow","type":"publication"},

This paper studies how bound tightening can improve convex relaxations for power network optimization. It adapts traditional constraint-programming concepts (eg, minimal network and bound consistency) to a relaxation framework and shows how bound tightening can dramatically improve power network optimization. In particular, the paper shows that the Quadratic Convex relaxation of power flows, enhanced by bound tightening, almost always outperforms the state-of-the-art Semi-Definite Programming relaxation on the optimal power flow problem.","tags":["selected"],"title":"Strengthening Convex Relaxations with Bound Tightening for Power Network Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sambuddha Chakrabarti","Dan Gordon","Paul Scott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1414821600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414821600,"objectID":"351aa49f90dddda741ccf0664c7eaf7d","permalink":"https://ccoffrin.github.io/publication/nesta/","publishdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nesta/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years the power systems research community has seen an explosion of work applying operations research techniques to challenging power network optimization problems. Regardless of the application under consideration, all of these works rely on power system test cases for evaluation and validation. However, many of the well established power system test cases were developed as far back as the 1960s with the aim of testing AC power flow algorithms. It is unclear if these power flow test cases are suitable for power system optimization studies. This report surveys all of the publicly available AC transmission system test cases, to the best of our knowledge, and assess their suitability for optimization tasks. It finds that many of the traditional test cases are missing key network operation constraints, such as line thermal limits and generator capability curves. To incorporate these missing constraints, data driven models are developed from a variety of publicly available data sources. The resulting extended test cases form a compressive archive, NESTA, for the evaluation and validation of power system optimization algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"NESTA, The NICTA Energy System Test Case Archive","type":"publication"},

However, AC power systems are governed by a system of nonlinear nonconvex power flow equations. Existing linear approximations fail to capture key power flow variables, including reactive power and voltage magnitudes, both of which are necessary in many applications that require voltage management and AC power flow feasibility. This paper proposes novel linear-programming models (the LPAC models) that incorporate reactive power and voltage magnitudes in a linear power flow approximation. The LPAC models are built on a polyhedral relaxation of the cosine terms in the AC equations as well as Taylor approximations of the remaining nonlinear terms. Experimental comparisons with AC solutions on a variety of standard IEEE and Matpower benchmarks show that the LPAC models produce accurate values for active and reactive power, phase angles, and voltage magnitudes. The potential benefits of the LPAC models are illustrated on two “proof-of-concept” studies in power restoration and capacitor placement.","tags":["selected"],"title":"A Linear-Programming Approximation of AC Power Flows","type":"publication"}
